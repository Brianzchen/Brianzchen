## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on JavaScript stuff mostly related to frontend.

### Stuff I'm interested in
- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and using it extensively day to day
- [flowtype](https://github.com/facebook/flow) and improving the community + tooling
- Web frontend architecture and microfrontends
- Component libraries
