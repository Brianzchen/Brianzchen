## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on JavaScript stuff mostly related to frontend. I love open source but just a newbie in the space

### Stuff I'm interested in
- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and using it extensively day to day and currently exploring React Native
- [flowtype](https://github.com/facebook/flow) advocate, an active maintainer building tooling/definitions on [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed) and [eslint-plugin-ft-flow](https://github.com/flow-typed/eslint-plugin-ft-flow)
- Web frontend architecture and microfrontends
- Component libraries
